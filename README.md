# mpvDLNA
A plugin to allow MPV to browse and watch content hosted on DLNA servers.

This project is a work in progress. More documentation to come.

## main.js
This file contains the gui and makes calls to the mpvDLNA.py file to get information from the DLNA server. Ultimately it just adds DLNA urls to the MPV playlist.

## mpvDLNA.py
This python script supports a few simple operations to detect and browse DLNA servers.
